This package is designed to handle data frame generation based on the
instructions available in "SQL dumps", or SQL script files containing table &
schema creation steps. These dump fles are often used as plain-text database
backups, and are also sometimes sent around within organizations as a means of
sharing data, without actually needing access to a database.
